# Remote Keyless Entry(RKE)
# Abstract
Remote keyless entry (RKE) is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. Typically, the action is to press a button on a physical fob or mobile app.

# SWOT Analysis
   * Strength 
     * Optimized power and range and Advance security
   * Weakness
	   * Replacing a lost fob costs much more than a traditional key
	   * it consist of electronic components which may damge easly when drop on hard surface.
   * Opportunities
	   * allow users to use their smartphones as keys and we can controlling extra features like remote start from anywhere within range
   * Threats
